## Linear Regression to predict MPG
The MechaCar_mpg.csv file depicts mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specs to identify prototypes car performance. Multiple metrics, such as car length and weight, spoiler angle and drivetrain were collected for each prototype. Using his knowledge of R, Jeremy designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv data file.

Deliverables:

The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe through the R console
An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables
An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values
There is a summary that addresses all three analysis above (see .R file in github):

Result of linear regression modelling:

Statistical summary:
From the above output we can see that:

The car length, and car ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. Therefore, the car length and ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Also, the car weight, spoiler angle, and AWD have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.

The p-Value for this model, p-Value: 5.35e-11, is much below the significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is not zero.

This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means approximately 71.5% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model.Concurrently, Jeremy's multiple regression model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

Removing the less impactful independent variables (car weight, spoiler angle, and AWD), the predictability does decrease, but not drastically: the r-squared value falls from 0.7149 to 0.6825.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv data file has the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. Using your knowledge of R, Jeremy created a summary statistics table to show:

The suspension coilâ€™s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots
The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

The Suspension Coil dataset provided for the MechaCar contains the results of testing the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils from multiple production lots to determine consistency.

First looking at all manufacturing lots:

Diving a little deeper into each of the 3 lots:

With the understanding that the design specs for the MechaCar suspension coils mandate that the variance of the suspension coils cannot exceed 100 pounds per square inch (PSI) .

When looking at the entire population of the production lot, the variance of the coils is 62.29 PSI, which is well within the 100 PSI variance requirement.

Similarly, but significantly more consistent, Lot 1 and Lot 2 are well within the 100 PSI variance requirement; with variances of 0.98 and 7.47 respectively. However, it is Lot 3 that is showing a much larger variance in performance and consistency, with a variance of 170.29. It is Lot 3 that is disproportionately causing the variance at the full lot level.

## t-Tests on Suspension Coils

The true mean of the sample is 1498.78, consistent with the summary statistics above. The p-Value of all 3 manufacturing lots is 0.06, which is higher than the assumed significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the mean of the three manufacturing lots is statistically similar to the population mean of 1500.

Lot 1 sample has the true sample mean of 1500. With a p-Value of 1, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there is no statistical difference between lot 1 sample mean and the population mean.

Lot 2 has the same result with sample mean of 1500.02, a p-Value of 0.61; the null hypothesis should be accepted, and the sample mean and the population mean are statistically similar.

Lot 3 is a different scenario: The sample mean is 1496.14 and the p-Value is 0.04. This is lower than the significance level of 0.05. Therefore, we will reject the null hypothesis that this sample mean and the population mean are not statistically different.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Metrics to be tested:
The metrics to test should be the price, MPG, safety rating, horsepower and drive package.

After determining which factors are key for the MechaCar's genre:

Null Hypothesis (Ho): MechaCar is priced correctly based on its performance of key factors for its category.

Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar is NOT priced correctly based on performance of key factors for its category.

Statistical tests to be conducted
A multiple linear regression would be used to determine the factors that have the highest correlation with the price (dependent variable) and what other independent variables (such as MPG, safety rating, horsepower, etc) that has the greatest impact on price.
