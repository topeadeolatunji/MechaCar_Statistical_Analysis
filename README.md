## Linear Regression to predict MPG
The MechaCar_mpg.csv file depicts mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using your knowledge of R, youâ€™ll design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.

Deliverables:

The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe through the R console
An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables
An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values
There is a summary that addresses all three questions:

Result of linear regression modelling:
